We have 2 cloud accounts

1) Managed cloud $80 premium for each VM on production.
2) They will log in and fix problems. 
3) Other cloud is "core" which is unmanaged. 
 = 80*12 = managed account has extra cost. 

As of right now:
* All non-production to core. 
* And in managed and all production servers. (3 non-production, qa app, qa database, qa harvester)
	(yum updates fails)

4) 32,000 = data infrastructure cost. 12,000 a month in saving switching to dedicated servers.
5) Research is for transient machines.
6) performance = staging.
7) servers saved images
* daily backups
* adhoc backups for every new server
8) Flow of main screen.
* create server button.
* server naming standard document in confluence. 
* Use password safe. 
* use centos 6.4 (always) * or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Now picking flavor (use to be standard) now we can choose Performance 1,2, and standard
* Performance 2 is db. 
* New Harvester machine is performance 2
* Always never touch network but PublicNet ServiceNet (dot-3 is created for use at NBA. )
* Region Chicago, Dallas distater recovery
* dot-3 192.168.168.m nic card for vertica.

Naming Convetion for images
Named templates use a naming conventions (T for template-OS-USAGE(APP-DB)-Environment(Monitor-QA))
OR
servername(dev-vertica)-od-TS

Provision
login
create
yum update.
yum update look at package list. 
add rabbit and mysql to exclude list. 
Inventory Server templates contains list of pre-installed packages. (add to inventory list, with installed items)
reboot
Failed to Band.
Rack space different than AWS, shutdown. Take an on demand image and delete the server. 

9) Operation Scripts (inside of dev-application)
* The script is called newuser. (in opsgithub repo)
* chown -R root:root 755 for /var/scripts
* misc <- contains newuser.sh
* Matt creates a sybolic link to /userlocal/sbin newuser -> /var/scripts/misc/newuser.sh (7)
newuser, there is almost always a -h option.

10) we don't delete there files in the delftpuser
11) delftpuser
12) Fresh desk, gets sent an ftp email. 
13) Rackspace is a great resource, they will stay on the phone with you. 
14) MyRackspace each device has a 6 nimber code + fw1 = db1(master),db2(replica),db3(performance)

15) Create loadbalancer.
* Least Connections
* Add nodes (or wait to add nodes)
* Builds a load balancer
* If there is an error on the port we have to delete and add back.
* Optional Features (health monitoring, disable if unhealthy)
* HTTP get status response or body regex.
* Health monitoring will not work for us because we use connect.
* No connection throttling.
* Session persistence on only for dashboard
* No error page http health check, maintenance page. 
16) ssl, generated needed ssl certificate and private key for all our environments
* have all keys
* CSR certictate signing request, supply that when you fill it out at webform. 
17) Tomcat procedure. is in all Matt's notes. 
18) Allow secure and in secure. -> always redirect to secure. 
19) to do midday deployment. 
20) Fix NLP deploy script. 

21) my.rackspace
* Network Policies (adminnbadev => )
22) contact support if you can hit the place directory but not through the load balancer.
23) opening ports is standard fare.
24) not ajax.
25)
